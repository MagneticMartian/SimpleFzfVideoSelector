# SimpleFzfVideoSelector
As the name says this is a simple video selector that uses fzf. This script is pulled from and updated from my older project f_expl.
# Dependencies
fzf and mpv
# videos.list file
If you do not wish to clutter up your computer with vidoes, and you know thw url to the streaming version of the video you can it into a file named vidoes.list. As the name suggests you can have as many urls in the file as you want. The selector lets you pick whick of the urls you wish to stream. You can also add descriptors of the video after the url.

An example videos.list file is listed so that the structure of the file can be demonstrated.
